``string``

Required","* The operating system running on the cluster.

* **Value**: ``ubuntu``."
"**cluster_os_version**

``string``

Required","* The OS Version that will be provisioned on compute nodes.

* For Ubuntu, the accepted values are 22.04 and 24.04.

* **Default value**: 22.04"
"**repo_config**

``string``

Required","* The type of offline configuration user needs.

* When the value is set to ``always``, Omnia creates a local repository/registry on the Control plane hosting all the packages/images required for the cluster.

* When the value is set to ``never``, Omnia does not create a local repository/registry. All the packages/images are directly downloaded on the cluster.

.. note::
  * After ``local_repo.yml`` has run, the value of ``repo_config`` in ``input/software_config.json`` cannot be updated without running the `control_plane_cleanup.yml <../../Maintenance/cleanup.html>`_ script first.
  * Irrespective of the value of ``repo_config``, all local repositories that are not available as images, debian packages, or RPMs will be downloaded and configured locally on the control plane. Additionally, AMD GPU drivers, Intel Gaudi drivers, CUDA, and OFED are downloaded by default if they are mentioned in the ``input/software_config.json``.

.. note:: The accepted names for software is taken from ``input/config/<cluster_os_type>/<cluster_os_version>``."
